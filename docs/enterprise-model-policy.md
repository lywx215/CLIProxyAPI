# Gemini Enterprise model policies

Each account collection stores its own `model_policy` under collection settings.
The default, including legacy credentials without the field, is `auto`.

| Policy | Allowed upstream models |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` | Trial Plus excludes `gemini-4-argon`; trial Business allows only Argon; other confirmed active subscriptions use the catalog. |
| `catalog` | Use the upstream catalog with existing exclusions. |
| `argon_only` | Only `gemini-4-argon`, if present upstream. |
| `exclude_argon` | The upstream catalog except Argon. |
| `custom` | Intersect the catalog with `allowed_models` when supplied. |

An absent or null `allowed_models` does not add a whitelist. An empty array blocks
every model in custom mode. Entries are exact upstream IDs. Existing
`excluded_models` apply in every mode, including provider-wide exclusions.
Switching modes preserves the dormant whitelist and existing exclusions.

Use the existing v8 collection PATCH endpoint, its `fields` object, and the current
`binding_id`, `auth_index` and `expected_revision`. Subscription observations and
`model_policy_state` in credential responses are read-only runtime data.

Automatic mode requires a verified assigned subscription. Observations refresh
in the background every five minutes. A temporary failure retains the last
confirmed policy for at most 30 minutes; first-time unknown, conflicting,
unassigned or inactive subscriptions pause automatic routing. Manual modes let
an administrator override this local policy; they do not grant Google access.
Observation caches are not persisted and are rebuilt after restart.

Subscription reads paginate unfiltered user licenses and match the verified OAuth
principal locally. Numeric project IDs avoid Cloud Resource Manager. Observations
are shared by authorization, project number and location; access-token refreshes
retain them, while replacement authorizations and obsolete asynchronous results
cannot overwrite the current decision. Explicit revocation, invalid bindings and
unknown subscription tiers stop automatic routing immediately.

License fields and effective states follow the [Google LicenseConfig reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/enterprise/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.licenseConfigs).
`DEACTIVATING` remains effective during Google's grace period.

Model registration filters real upstream IDs before aliases and prefixes are
generated. Every generation validates its final model after payload rules,
including streaming, media, pinned model tests and raw management streamAssist
requests. Local refusals do not invoke Google generation or establish quota
cooldowns. No subscription lookup is added to an inference request.
